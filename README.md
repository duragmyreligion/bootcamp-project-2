# bootcamp-project-2

## Description
In this project we carefully crafted a full-stack application customised to create a community among gamers and those alike. 

Our platform aims to provide an accessible sense of freedom to vocalise thoughts and opinions within the gaming community. Whether you’re new or a veteran to the gaming world, we aim to provide players with easy access to informative posts and reviews of various games.

Our motivation is to provide an accessible, friendly and casual platform for gamers. 

Our Aim:
• Ensure any type of player finds our platform easy to navigate, as we created the visual appeal with the user in mind.
• Allowing users to have a sense of security logging into our platform and enjoy participating with our custom community based design.
• A place for all players in the gaming world to be involved in, having the option to talk about any games. 
• Enhanced engagement through our active community.
